The project titled "NGS Project on Saccharomyces cerevisiae" focuses on investigating the mechanism of synergy between the antifungal agent amphotericin B (AMB) and the iron chelator lactoferrin (LF) in the context of invasive fungal infections (IFIs).

Project Title: NGS Project on Saccharomyces cerevisiae

Research Focus: Investigating the Mechanism of Synergy between Amphotericin B (AMB) and Lactoferrin (LF) in Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs)

Objective: The primary objective of the project is to understand how the combination of amphotericin B and lactoferrin exerts a synergistic effect against invasive fungal infections caused by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This involves exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the observed synergy.

Background:

Amphotericin B (AMB): AMB is a well-known antifungal agent used to treat a variety of fungal infections. It works by binding to fungal cell membranes, disrupting their integrity, and ultimately leading to cell death.

Lactoferrin (LF): LF is an iron-binding protein that plays a role in the host's defense against infections. It sequesters iron, an essential nutrient for many microorganisms, including fungi, thereby inhibiting their growth and survival.

Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs): IFIs are serious and often life-threatening infections caused by fungal pathogens that invade tissues and organs, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Understanding mechanisms to combat these infections is crucial.

Hypothesis: The project's hypothesis is that the combination of amphotericin B and lactoferrin leads to a synergistic effect, enhancing the antifungal activity and inhibiting the growth and survival of Saccharomyces cerevisiae more effectively than either agent alone.

Methods and Approach:

Experimental Design: The project involves both in vitro and possibly in vivo experiments using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism.
setup involving treatments with AMB (Amphotericin B) and LF (Lactoferrin), as well as corresponding controls. Here's a breakdown of the steps described in the protocol:

Sample Preparation:

RNAse zap treated 0.4 μm beads and lyophilized cells are used for sample homogenization.
Bead beating is performed using a Minilys tissue homogenizer at 5,000 rpm for 2 minutes. Cooling on ice occurs at 1-minute intervals.
RNA Isolation:

Total RNA is isolated using the Qiagen total RNA mini isolation kit.
RNA Quality Analysis:

RNA quality is assessed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) to ensure appropriate OD260/230 and OD260/280 ratios (between 1.8 and 2).
RNA quality is further evaluated using an RNA Quality Indicator (RQI) measurement with a Bioanalyzer (Bio-Rad).
RNA Concentration Measurement:

RNA concentration is quantified using the Qubit BR RNA assay kit from Invitrogen.
Library Preparation (AMB+LF Treatment and Controls):

TruSeq RNA Library prep kit v2 (Illumina) is used for library preparation.
2 μg of total RNA from each of the three biological triplicate samples is used as input.
Libraries are enriched using 15 cycles of PCR.
Insert sizes in the libraries range from 80 to 330 base pairs (bp).
Libraries are randomized and sequenced in two separate lanes using HiSeq 2000 with TruSeq v3 SBS reagents to generate 100 bp paired-end reads.
Demultiplexing of the data is performed using Casava 1.8.2.
Library Preparation (LF Only Treatment and Controls):

TruSeq Stranded mRNA-seq prep kit is used for library preparation.
1 μg of total RNA from each of the three biological triplicate samples is used as input.
Libraries are enriched using 12 cycles of PCR to minimize PCR duplicates.
Libraries are multiplexed and sequenced on the same flow cell using NextSeq500 v2 reagents to generate 75 bp single reads.
Demultiplexing of the data is performed using Casava 1.8.2.
This protocol outlines the steps for RNA sample isolation, quality assessment, library preparation, and sequencing for two different treatments (AMB+LF and LF only) along with their corresponding controls. It provides important details for each step to ensure reproducibility and accuracy in the experimental process.

NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing): NGS techniques, such as RNA-seq, may be used to analyze changes in gene expression profiles upon treatment with AMB, LF, and their combination. This can provide insights into the molecular pathways affected by the treatment.

Cell Viability Assays: Various assays, such as MTT assays or CFU (colony-forming unit) assays, could be used to assess the viability and growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under different treatment conditions.

Microscopy: Microscopic techniques may be employed to visualize cellular changes, membrane integrity, and morphological alterations in fungal cells upon treatment.

Expected Outcomes:

Identification of Synergistic Effects: The project aims to confirm and characterize the synergistic effects of amphotericin B and lactoferrin against Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Mechanistic Insights: The research may provide insights into the molecular pathways and cellular processes affected by the combination treatment, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the observed synergy.

Potential Therapeutic Applications: Understanding the synergistic effects could have implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for invasive fungal infections, potentially leading to more effective treatment options.

Significance:

Invasive fungal infections pose a significant threat, especially to immunocompromised individuals. This project's findings could contribute to the development of innovative treatment approaches that enhance the efficacy of existing antifungal agents, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing the emergence of drug resistance.
