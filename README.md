The project titled "NGS Project on Saccharomyces cerevisiae" focuses on investigating the mechanism of synergy between the antifungal agent amphotericin B (AMB) and the iron chelator lactoferrin (LF) in the context of invasive fungal infections (IFIs).

Project Title: NGS Project on Saccharomyces cerevisiae

Research Focus: Investigating the Mechanism of Synergy between Amphotericin B (AMB) and Lactoferrin (LF) in Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs)

Objective: The primary objective of the project is to understand how the combination of amphotericin B and lactoferrin exerts a synergistic effect against invasive fungal infections caused by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This involves exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the observed synergy.

Background:

Amphotericin B (AMB): AMB is a well-known antifungal agent used to treat a variety of fungal infections. It works by binding to fungal cell membranes, disrupting their integrity, and ultimately leading to cell death.

Lactoferrin (LF): LF is an iron-binding protein that plays a role in the host's defense against infections. It sequesters iron, an essential nutrient for many microorganisms, including fungi, thereby inhibiting their growth and survival.

Invasive Fungal Infections (IFIs): IFIs are serious and often life-threatening infections caused by fungal pathogens that invade tissues and organs, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Understanding mechanisms to combat these infections is crucial.

Hypothesis: The project's hypothesis is that the combination of amphotericin B and lactoferrin leads to a synergistic effect, enhancing the antifungal activity and inhibiting the growth and survival of Saccharomyces cerevisiae more effectively than either agent alone.

Methods and Approach:

Experimental Design: The project involves both in vitro and possibly in vivo experiments using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism.

NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing): NGS techniques, such as RNA-seq, may be used to analyze changes in gene expression profiles upon treatment with AMB, LF, and their combination. This can provide insights into the molecular pathways affected by the treatment.

Cell Viability Assays: Various assays, such as MTT assays or CFU (colony-forming unit) assays, could be used to assess the viability and growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under different treatment conditions.

Microscopy: Microscopic techniques may be employed to visualize cellular changes, membrane integrity, and morphological alterations in fungal cells upon treatment.

Expected Outcomes:

Identification of Synergistic Effects: The project aims to confirm and characterize the synergistic effects of amphotericin B and lactoferrin against Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Mechanistic Insights: The research may provide insights into the molecular pathways and cellular processes affected by the combination treatment, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying the observed synergy.

Potential Therapeutic Applications: Understanding the synergistic effects could have implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for invasive fungal infections, potentially leading to more effective treatment options.

Significance:

Invasive fungal infections pose a significant threat, especially to immunocompromised individuals. This project's findings could contribute to the development of innovative treatment approaches that enhance the efficacy of existing antifungal agents, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing the emergence of drug resistance.
